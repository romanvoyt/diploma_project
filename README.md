# Enterprise bankruptcy prediction using machine learning techniques
## Abstract
Currrent repository represents program code, which was used for scientific research purposes. Especially, this code helps to understand which machine learning models and oversampling techniques are best for bankruptcy prediction.

## To DO

1. Change the way to optimize hyperparameters (use optuna)
2. Implement results saving to csv/xlsx files
3. Refactor pipelines with oversampling methods

## Updates

11.28.22 - Code refactoring and new readme
